# Odyssey
Custom Pure UI for commonwealth.gg

## About
Odyssey is an alternative Frontend to the Commonwealth P3C Smart Contract, based on the Pure configuration. It leverages Bootstrap's mobile-first responsive design language, while providing a slick UI for users to quickly perform their business with Commonwealth, and carry forth.

## What's Next?
This is only the first of many stepping stones to a fully-fledged platform, which will enable people to truly grasp the power of Points, earning dividends and building a truly strong decentralised network, as both Commonwealth and Odyssey continue to grow.

## Can I help?
