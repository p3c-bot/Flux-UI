# Flux UI
Alternative Pure Interface for Commonwealth (formerly P3C)

## About
Flux UI is an alternative Pure Interface to the Commonwealth Smart Contract. It leverages the Bootstrap 4 framework with customised theme elements - providing a unique design and experience, while providing a solid structure of information and control for users to make use of and grow their wealth with the Contract.

## What's Next?
This is only the first of many stepping stones to a fully-fledged platform, which will enable people to truly grasp the power of Commonwealth Points, earning dividends and building a truly strong decentralised network, as both Commonwealth and Flux continue to grow.

## Can I help?
Sure thing! If you would like to contribute something to Flux, I'm happy to review any and all pull requests! Simply create a fork of this repo, make your changes, and submit a new Pull Request!

## Can I have my own Flux?
Absolutely! Create a fork of this repo or download it as a ZIP, put it in a localhost or apache/nginx server (or in a folder, and run `live-server` from the root dir of the project). You might also wish to change the masternode address, too - this way, you can collect the 33% Masternode fee of every 10% Dividend tax!

## I found a bug!
Did you really?! If you know how to fix it, feel free to submit a Pull Request. If you don't, feel free to open a new issue on this repo, and provide as much detail as you can. I'll be most swift to fix these things!

## I want to donate!
Thank you very much! There's a donation button in the footer of every page on Flux - if you click it, you'll see options for donation - your support is very much appreciated!
